## 📄 This project in short

The project, led by Julien Geneste, the founder of Kariboo, consists of the creation *as quickly as possible* a *minimum viable product* of a **seed cannon mechanism** that can be mounted on a **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle** (UAV). This mechanism will consist of : 
 - seed projection module
 - storage module 
 - drone guidance system 
 - algorithm that will find the ideal positions for depositing seeds on the ground. 

The objectives are to find a solution that will allow the seeds to be shot, with precision and without destabilizing the drone, and to put in place a strategy to maximize the chances of survival of the shoot.

This project was created in response to the many fires in Gironde and more generally in France.
